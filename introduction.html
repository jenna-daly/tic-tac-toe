	<h2>What is Tic-Tac-Toe?</h2>

	<p>Tic-tac-toe (also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. (From Wikipedia) </p>

	<p> The Tic-Tac-Toe game we will make would be: </p>
	<ul> 
		<li>a two-player game</li>
		<li>player “X” and “O” take turns to play the game (click on buttons)</li>
		<li>game ends when either one player wins, or all buttons are clicked without a winner</li>
	</ul> </div><hr>
